"My uncle has most honest principles:
when he was taken gravely ill,
he forced one to respect him
and nothing better could invent.
To others his example is a lesson;
but, good God, what a bore to sit
by a sick person day and night, not stirring
a step away!
What base perfidiousness
to entertain one half-alive,
adjust for him his pillows,
sadly serve him his medicine,
sigh - and think inwardly
when will the devil take you?"

It was what a young rake expected,
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
By Zeus's supreme will elected
The only heir of all his kin.
The friends of â€œRuslan and Lyudmila"!
Here is my novel in verse hero,
With no preface and just right now
Let me acquaint you with the one:
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Was born on Neva's even shores,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
Or where you used to shine and revel.
It's where I also used to play,
But North is not for me, they say*.

His father served exactly fairly
Relying mostly on a debt,
At least three balls used to give yearly
And became bankrupt in the end.
Eugene's fate, though, was well disposed:
At first, a Madame cared and nursed,
Then, paltry French cared for the kid.
The boy was frisky, but still sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbe was not too formal
Didn't want to spoil the child's rest,
Preferred to teach him just in jest
And didn't bore him with strict moral,
Reproved for pranks by gentle talk
To Summer Garden took for walk.

And when the childhood was over,
There came the time for youthful play,
The time of hopes and tender sorrow,
Monsieur was fired right away.
No one restrained Onegin's passion,
His hair was cut in modern fashion,
Like London dandy he was clothed
And finally had seen beau monde.
He demonstrated perfect bearing:
Could speak good French and wrote as well;
He danced Mazurka very well
And made a bow without straining.
What else you need? Beau monde could say
That he was very nice and sane.
